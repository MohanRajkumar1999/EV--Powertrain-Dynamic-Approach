# EV--Powertrain-Dynamic-Approach
By varying the PID controller parameters in a dynamic powertrain model under different drive cycles, we are determining the optimal values for motor torque, motor speed, battery capacity, battery power, regenerative torque, SOC, range, and other related parameters, using Nissan Leaf data
Check out the ppt I have included different values of motor and battery under different drive cycle.
